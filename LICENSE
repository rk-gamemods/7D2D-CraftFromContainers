ProxiCraft is an independent mod for 7 Days to Die that allows crafting, 
reloading, refueling, and repairs using items from nearby storage containers.

INSPIRATION & PRIOR ART:
This mod was inspired by the "Craft From Containers" concept, which has been
implemented by various modders over the years. We studied open-source code
from these projects for ideas and approaches:
- aedenthorn - CraftFromContainers (NexusMods, GitHub)
- SYN0N1M - CraftFromContainers v1.0 update
- llmonmonll - CraftFromContainersPlus
- FoxFlicker - Patch contributions

This implementation is an independent work with different design choices:
- Balanced 15-block default range (vs unlimited)
- Challenge tracker integration (new feature)
- SafePatcher system for robust mod loading
- AdaptivePatching for mod compatibility
- ModCompatibility conflict detection
