## ProxiCraft v1.2.4

### Summary
Bug fix for enhanced safety mode not working after switching between game sessions.

### Changes
- **Fixed**: Enhanced safety mode breaking features (repair, reload, refuel, etc.) when switching between single-player and multiplayer sessions
- **Fixed**: Multiplayer state now properly resets when starting a new game, preventing stale flags from blocking functionality

### Technical Details
The issue occurred because multiplayer tracking state (`_isHosting`, `_immediatelyLockMod`, etc.) was never reset when starting a new game. If a user played multiplayer, then started single-player, the stale flags would cause `IsModAllowed()` to return `false`, silently disabling enhanced safety features.

### Installation
1. Download ProxiCraft-1.2.4.zip
2. Extract and copy ProxiCraft folder to 7 Days To Die/Mods/
3. Launch game with EAC disabled

**Multiplayer**: Install on server AND all clients (same version)
