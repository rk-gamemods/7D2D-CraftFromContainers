## ProxiCraft v1.2.4

### Summary
Bug fixes for enhanced safety mode session switching and block repair from remote storage.

### Changes
- **Fixed**: Enhanced safety mode breaking features when switching between single-player and multiplayer sessions
- **Fixed**: Multiplayer state now properly resets when starting a new game
- **Fixed**: Block repair (damaged blocks) now correctly uses repair materials from nearby containers

### Technical Details
- Session switching: Multiplayer tracking state was never reset when starting a new game, causing stale flags to disable features
- Block repair: Game uses different code paths for repair vs upgrade; now both paths pull from nearby containers
