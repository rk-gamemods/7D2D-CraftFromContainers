## ProxiCraft v1.2.4

### Summary
Bug fixes for enhanced safety mode session switching and block repair from remote storage.

### Changes
- **Fixed**: Enhanced safety mode breaking features (repair, reload, refuel, etc.) when switching between single-player and multiplayer sessions
- **Fixed**: Multiplayer state now properly resets when starting a new game, preventing stale flags from blocking functionality
- **Fixed**: Block repair (damaged blocks) now correctly uses repair materials from nearby containers
  - Previously only block UPGRADE used container materials; block REPAIR did not

### Technical Details
**Session switching fix**: The issue occurred because multiplayer tracking state (`_isHosting`, `_immediatelyLockMod`, etc.) was never reset when starting a new game. If a user played multiplayer, then started single-player, the stale flags would cause `IsModAllowed()` to return `false`, silently disabling enhanced safety features.

**Block repair fix**: The game uses different code paths for repairing damaged blocks vs upgrading blocks. ProxiCraft previously only patched the upgrade path (`CanRemoveRequiredResource`/`RemoveRequiredResource`). Now we also patch the repair path (`canRemoveRequiredItem`/`removeRequiredItem`) so repair materials are pulled from nearby containers when the player doesn't have enough in their inventory.
2. Extract and copy ProxiCraft folder to 7 Days To Die/Mods/
3. Launch game with EAC disabled

**Multiplayer**: Install on server AND all clients (same version)
