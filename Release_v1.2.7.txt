Network Stability Improvements

[b]Fixed:[/b]
[list]
[*]Fixed multiplayer handshake packet loss causing mod to lock up for entire server session
[*]Fixed orphan container locks when players disconnect (containers no longer stay "locked" forever)
[*]Fixed race condition where out-of-order packets could cause ghost locks
[*]Added lock expiration (5 min default) - ghost locks self-heal automatically
[*]Added retry mechanism for handshake and lock broadcasts on connection hiccups
[*]Added lock retry cancellation to prevent stale locks after rapid open/close
[*]Improved error handling in packet deserialization
[/list]

[b]New Config Option:[/b]
[code]"containerLockExpirySeconds": 30[/code]
Time in seconds before container locks auto-expire (default 30 seconds).
Locks are a UX courtesy to prevent "where did my items go?" when someone has a container open.
They are NOT required for crash prevention.

[b]Installation:[/b]
