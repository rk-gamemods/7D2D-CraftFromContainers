## ProxiCraft v1.2.5

### Summary
Fixed mod failing to load on dedicated server hosting panels like CubeCoders AMP.

### Changes
- Added robust path detection with multiple fallback methods
- Mod now checks both AppData and game install Mods folders (matching how the game itself loads mods)
- Added diagnostic logging to help troubleshoot hosting issues

### Technical Details
Previously, ProxiCraft used `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location` to find its folder. This returns an empty string on some hosting panels that shadow-copy or manage assemblies differently.

Now the mod tries multiple methods in order:
1. Assembly location (standard)
2. Assembly code base (legacy fallback)
3. Ask the game where user data is stored, check Mods folder there
4. Ask the game where it's installed, check Mods folder there
5. Check relative to the application's working directory
6. Environment variable override (last resort)

### For Server Hosts
If you're still having issues after updating (very rare), you can set an environment variable:
- Name: PROXICRAFT_PATH
- Value: Full path to ProxiCraft folder (e.g., C:\GameServers\7DaysToDie\Mods\ProxiCraft)

### Installation
1. Download ProxiCraft-1.2.5.zip
2. Extract and copy ProxiCraft folder to 7 Days To Die/Mods/
3. Launch game with EAC disabled

**Multiplayer**: Install on server AND all clients (same version)
